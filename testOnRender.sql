Your role will not be 	\n    \n    \n    \n            Secret Government is a grand strategy game about a secret society. Remaining unseen, they have been ruling mankind for hundreds of years. Your role will not be just to lead a particular country or region, but the Brotherhood — a centuries-old organization that works in the shadows and manipulates the entire world. Pull the strings of fate as you influence the present and future on a global scale, reconstructing the whole world to your liking.<br><br>\nStrategically manage your agents as they run errands in different regions and infiltrate government institutions to strip countries of their resources and seize control of decision-makers. Your choices will change the internal and foreign policies of countries.<br><br>\nA desire for power and wealth is not the only thing that drives the Brotherhood. It strives for a complete rebuilding of the world.<br><br>\nBeginning in the 17th century, you start making your own history, where in each mission of the game you will interfere in the main conflict of a certain period. Take part in the Glorious Revolution in England, where you face a hostile secret organization with methods similar to yours, but with goals completely different; or influence the struggle of the thirteen colonies for independence from the British rule in the “New World” and decide the fate of the American Revolution.<br><br>\nAct slowly and carefully so as not to raise awareness of your clout in each-country,Otherwise you will be exposed and lose the level of influence already gained..<br><br>\nThere will be plenty of diplomatic, economic and military actions at your disposal. Pay close attention to the domestic politics of each country. If the ruling party’s ideology is very different from the views of various classes and estates, if tax levels are too high and public order too low, then expect a revolution. Or maybe this is what you seek?<br><br>\nYou cannot impose your will on the rulers - your manipulations in the game are indirect. You do not have the power to order a monarch to declare war on a neighboring country, but you can plant your agents in the right places, provoke deterioration in relations by indirect actions, arrange a border incident and bring the countries to a military conflict.<br><br>\nWe hope that you will spend many enjoyable hours exploring how the world works with Secret Government! Join the Brotherhood!\n<h4>Key Features</h4><ul><li><b>Rewrite History</b> - From the 17th century to the present day, from the Glorious Revolution to the War of Independence, each mission will drop players into major global conflicts, tasking them with manipulating the outcome to serve the Brotherhood’s ambitions.</li><li><b>Play Your Pawns</b> - The world’s most powerful figures - from national rulers to military superpowers - are but mere pawns to you. Learn to manipulate their complex AI machinations as you leverage their unique abilities to shape the world to your needs.</li><li><b>Indirect Influence</b> - Why should you have to do the heavy lifting of executing your diplomatic, economic, and militaristic ambitions? Plant your own agents and indirectly coerce others to do your bidding with over 50 types of actions intended to upend the world’s balance in your favor while keeping your hands clean.</li><li><b>Manipulate a Living World</b> - From ideologies to social classes, taxes to civil unrest, the world of Secret Government comprises countless interconnected sociopolitical systems that effectively simulate a believable and reactionary world. While world leaders strive to maintain the status quo, how will you destabilize the system and trigger worldwide change?</li><li><b>You’re Not Alone in the Shadows</b> - Facing down a hostile secret organization that isn’t afraid to manipulate their way into the history books, make every action and choice count in order to outthink the competition and maintain your hard-earned secrecy and level of infiltration in the shadows.</li></ul><p class="description__copyrights">\n            © 2020-2021 Fulqrum Publishing Ltd.

A weaker opponent can choose to engage in guerrilla warfare, raiding supply depots and refineries, blockading colonies, and otherwise attacking each point in the enemy supply chain.

It adds a brand new environment for you to explore and master – freshwater!Your new inhabitants	<a href="https://www.gog.com/promo/2022_winter_sale" target="_blank"><img src="https://items.gog.com/promobanners/2022-winter-sale2.png"></a><br><hr><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/megaquarium_freshwater_frenzy_-_deluxe_expansion/ff_store_page_header.png"><br><i><b>Freshwater Frenzy</b></i> is the first Deluxe Expansion for <i><b><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/megaquarium">Megaquarium</a></b></i>. It adds a brand new environment for you to explore and master – freshwater!<h4>Your new inhabitants</h4>From the prehistoric Arapaima to the infamous Piranha, <i><b>Freshwater Frenzy</b></i> is packed full of new species to discover. There are new care requirements to learn and demanding new aquascaping requirements to fulfil. From floating cover to bogwood, providing everything your inhabitants need will challenge even the seasoned curator!\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/megaquarium_freshwater_frenzy_-_deluxe_expansion/ff_angels.jpg"><h4>Become a breeder</h4>For the first time in <i><b><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/megaquarium">Megaquarium</a></b></i> history you will be able to rear baby animals in your aquarium. But make no mistake, fulfilling the unique breeding requirements of each animal is no easy task. Then there’s raising the young themselves, a job fraught with difficulties and requiring your constant attention.<h4>Ready, get set, hybridize!</h4>Some species can even be hybridized. By selective breeding you can create color and pattern combinations that reflect your style.\n<br><img src="https://items.gog.com/megaquarium_freshwater_frenzy_-_deluxe_expansion/ff_hybrids.png"><h4>Introducing pH</h4>If that wasn’t enough, some animals will require you to maintain a specific pH in the tank. Will you satisfy this with clever use of passive sources? Or will you let the machines do the heavy lifting? The choice is yours.<h4>Accessories and posters</h4>Accessories are a brand new tool in your arsenal to optimize your aquarium. Equip them on your staff for powerful bonuses, but choose carefully, only one accessory may be equipped at a time.\n<br><br>\nDisseminate facts and fun by placing informative posters around your aquarium. Their value relies on the contents of the connected tank so design your exhibits wisely.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/megaquarium_freshwater_frenzy_-_deluxe_expansion/ff_poster_accessory.jpg"><h4>Reptiles and new tanks</h4>Reptiles such as turtles and crocs require land as well as water. Thankfully there are new tank designs which fulfil this need.\n<br><br>\nMeanwhile, tanks with suspended platforms can be used to bridge different areas of your aquarium together, while exciting your guests with a thrilling new perspective!<h4>Freshwater masterclass</h4>Explore everything that freshwater has to offer by completing the <i><b>Freshwater Frenzy</b></i> campaign. Each mission will challenge you to make the most of the new additions and explore the game in new ways.<h4>Features</h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li>5 levels in a freshwater-focused campaign\n<br></li><li>30 freshwater species\n<br></li><li>7 new tanks\n<br></li><li>4 accessories to equip your staff\n<br></li><li>Dozens of new objects including decorations, plants, equipment and posters \n<br></li><li>4 brand new paints to keep your aquarium looking “fresh”</li></ul><p class="description__copyrights">\n            Copyright © 2020 Twice Circled Ltd.

Import your character from the main campaign to the moment of their greatest triumph — their victory over the Worldwound. Answer a plea from a powerful entity and leave Golarion behind to defend the space-time continuum against imminent collapse. Use your unparalleled mythic powers to do battle with truly invincible opponents. This additional campaign offers 7–8 hours of gameplay.\n\n<h4>DLC #2:</h4>\nNew additional campaign. The demon attack on Kenabres changed the lives of many. While the mythic hero and their loyal companions were busy liberating the city, the common folk had to find a way to survive, relying only on their humble skills.\nBand together with other survivors and try to reach the Defender's Heart tavern, the last foothold of the crusader forces in the city. Choose who will join your group, and make difficult decisions about allocating scarce resources. Remember — in fire-ravaged Kenabres, every scroll and potion could make the difference not only in an individual fight but also to your very survival. Act in the group's best interests or focus solely on your own well-being. Import your choices to the main campaign and look forward to seeing this story develop in other DLC. This additional campaign offers 6–7 hours of gameplay.\n\n<h4>DLC #3:</h4>\nA new rogue-like mode with partial integration into the main campaign. In Alushinyrra's port, climb aboard a cursed ship that will transport you to a mysterious whirlpool lost amidst the Midnight Isles. Dive in and discover a dungeon whose proportions you can only guess at. Go exploring in search of glory, loot, and battles, and come face to face with a secret that will benefit either Nocticula, the mistress of the archipelago, or her enemies. The dungeon's levels, created using random zone generation, are populated with various enemies, devious traps, and secret rooms. You will return victorious to Alushinyrra — or else the cursed ship will return on its own, laden with trophies from the last expedition, to await new adventure-seekers.\n\n\n\n            \n    	296.99	2021-09-01	BR0	22	2023-01-04 00:50:03.419-03	\N	\N	2023-01-04 00:50:07.571-03	2023-01-04 00:50:07.726-03

Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading screens, and no limits. In this infinite procedurally generated universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again.\n<br><br><h4>Now including...</h4>Play with all major updates since launch: Foundation, Pathfinder, Atlas Rises, NEXT, The Abyss, Visions, the 2.0 BEYOND update, Synthesis, Living Ship, Exo Mech, Desolation and the 3.0 update, ORIGINS, Next Generation, Companions and Expeditions.\n<br><br>\nAn epic voyage to the centre of a shared universe awaits, allowing you to explore, trade, fight and survive alone or with friends.\n\n<br><br><h4>Embark on an epic voyage</h4>At the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos. But, facing hostile creatures and fierce pirates, you'll know that death comes at a cost, and survival will be down to the choices you make over how you upgrade your ship, your weapon and suit.\n<br><br><h4>Find your own destiny</h4>Your voyage through No Man's Sky is up to you. Will you be a fighter, preying on the weak and taking their riches, or taking out pirates for their bounties? Power is yours if you upgrade your ship for speed and weaponry.\n<br><br>\n\nOr a trader? Find rich resources on forgotten worlds and exploit them for the highest prices. Invest in more cargo space and you'll reap huge rewards.\n<br>\n\nOr perhaps an explorer? Go beyond the known frontier and discover places and things that no one has ever seen before. Upgrade your engines to jump ever farther, and strengthen your suit for survival in toxic environments that would kill the unwary.\n<br><br><h4>Share your journey</h4>The galaxy is a living, breathing place. Trade convoys travel between stars, factions vie for territory, pirates hunt the unwary, and the police are ever watching. Every other player lives in the same galaxy, and you can choose to share your discoveries with them on a map that spans known space. Perhaps you will see the results of their actions as well as your own...\n\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            No Man's Sky - TM/ © 2016 Hello Games Ltd.

I discovered this game by chance as a kid - I was wondering what to play next (and I’ve just begun my lifelong adventure with PC gaming) and this game was added to my newly bought graphics card. I installed it and after the first minutes in Seyda Neen I knew that it was it - unique setting, weird monsters and the freedom to just walk around Vvardenfell, visit different cities, read (a lot of) books and do quests for different factions. \n\nI go back to this game quite often (apreciating the music in the game even more) and go on an adventure with a newly created character. Morrowind is definitely a must play for everyone who loves cRPGs or looks for an unique open world setting and I hope that you will like it as much as I do.

His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’.\n<br><br>\nBanter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments. Clever puzzles, bizarre situations, and devastating ripostes are all that stand between Guybrush and glory.<h4>Return to Point &amp; Click Swashbuckling</h4>Bringing classic point and click gameplay to the modern-day, intrepid pirates will solve puzzles and explore the islands with a clever evolution of classic adventure game controls. Context-sensitive interactions, reactive dialog trees, and an easy-to-use inventory system make pirating a breeze.<h4>Embark on Archipelago Adventures</h4>Navigate the sometimes-friendly confines of Melee Island, a familiar place that finds itself under new management by leaders who have put the squeeze on old friends and new faces. Venture out into uncharted lands like the aptly named Terror Island and the chilling outposts of Brrr Muda to make allies and enemies alike.<h4>Created by a Legendary Crew</h4>The new chapter in the Monkey Island series marks the return of the iconic series’ creator Ron Gilbert, joined by game co-writer Dave Grossman, art director Rex Crowle (Knights &amp; Bikes, Tearaway) and composers Peter McConnell, Michael Land, and Clint Bajakian (Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge).\n\n\n            \n    	51.89	2022-11-27	BR0	1	2023-01-04 00:49:57.166-03	\N	\N	2023-01-04 00:49:57.923-03	2023-01-04 00:50:06.942-03

They founded farms, raised cattle, dug for gold, built settlements and towns. \n<br><br>\nA small find of gold is often enough to draw hundreds of daring adventurers while quickly a small settlement becomes a flourishing town with saloons, merchants, gambling, adventurers, and gunslingers... \n<br><br>\nEnter this breathtakingly exciting time and conquer the Wild West.

You start repairing and expanding. You gather food, hunt for animals and sell their meat and leather to settler trecks. Once you have established a decent ranch, other settlers may decide to stay and ask for permission to settle down. You start building a town with all its classic locations such as saloon, Sheriff office, stores and even hotels.

The famed Slovakian highlander and robber Janosik just finished a quest to rescue his comrades and is now on the path to defeat even more enemies – both mythical and historical. This time around, it’s not the band of brothers that’s missing, but rather Janosik himself. Caught with an ingenious ruse, our hero must rescue himself, his beloved and make new friends on the way.\n<br><h4>STORY</h4>\nAccompany Highlander Janosik, Bogdan the Werewolf and a cloak-wrapped Vampire as they explore the dark and trap-filled castle von Zur, house to the nefarious kidnapper Baron. Trek through dense mountain forests that are home to feral dogs, headless skeletons and more, all bent on making your life harder. Bear in mind though, that there might be something even more sinister waiting for you at the end of the journey...\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/janosik_2/1.gif"><br><h4>A bigger adventure</h4>\nThree new chapters, each one bigger and filled with even more gameplay than the whole original Janosik game - and filled to the brink with new characters, enemies and environmental threat.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/janosik_2/2.gif"><br><h4>These Walls Were Meant to Be Broken</h4>\nFor the first time ever,  use the powerful club of Bogdan the Vampire to smash walls to smithereens and enter places formerly off-limits.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/janosik_2/3.gif"><br><h4>Die, Die and Repea... Die Again</h4>\nLightning quick reflexes, good muscle memory and thinking two steps ahead will sadly - not be enough to finish Janosik in one sitting. But at least the checkpoints are plentiful and restarts - instanenous. \n<br><h4>Is This A Joke to You?</h4>\nA highlander, a vampire and a werewolf enter a dungeon... and emerge - hopefully - with the Highlander's rescued bride while meeting, fighting and hopefully defeating everyone and everything that stands in your way.\n<br><h4>Scenes That Cut</h4>\nEnjoy the short breaks in an exhilarating experience by admiring the cutscenes that signify important events of Janosik, beautifully  presented in all their full, 100+colors, hand-drawn and animated glory. You wil never skip a cutscene featuring a mountable sheep again.\n<br><h4>Get Collecting</h4>\nThe legend says Janosik robbed the rich to give to the poor. Janosik 2 makes good on that first part, with a real dearth of treasures, coins, diamonds and other precious stones to grab from the coffers of the manacing and power hungry villains of the game.\n\n<br><br><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nx6CmMNgrj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://items.gog.com/Retrovibe_discord_banner.png" style="width:100%"></a>	526.19	1969-12-31	BR0	71	2023-01-04 00:51:59.381-03	\N	\N	2023-01-04 00:52:05.075-03	2023-01-04 00:52:07.765-03

New friends and enemies, dangers and rewards await you — both as extensions of the main campaign and as standalone experiences.\n\n<h4>DLC #4</h4>\nHere comes a new companion for the Knight Commander's party and a new playable class: the everchanging shifter! Bolster your party with a reliable brawler, capable of taking on the aspects of various wild beasts. Delve into the lost secrets of Old Sarkoris. And who knows? Maybe you will even find new love, one transcending time itself.\n\n<h4>DLC #5</h4>\nThis new standalone campaign picks up where the “Through the Ashes” story left off. A new demon lord with hordes of frozen minions is emerging from the depths of the Abyss. With the Knight Commander busy elsewhere, what can a group of regular adventurers with no mythic powers do to save the day? This expansion offers a 6-7 hourlong story which you can play independently or with the hero from your “Through the Ashes” savegame. And when you're done, a whole new dungeon in the main campaign will be open for the Knight Commander to explore.\n\n<h4>DLC #6</h4>\nDuring your first visit to Kenabres, things did not go well. Now that the demonic assault has been thwarted, and the crusaders are preparing their final counterattack, why not take a little break? Kenabres, burned and rebuilt, is holding a new festival, and the Knight Commander will be the guest of honor. This is your chance to spend some quality time away from the battlefields together with your companions – and, perhaps, go on a special date with your loved one. Be careful, though: the war isn't over yet, and even the new, peaceful Kenabres might be hiding its share of secrets...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n    	86.99	2023-01-30	BR0	22	2023-01-04 00:51:59.156-03	\N	\N	2023-01-04 00:52:05.075-03	2023-01-04 00:52:07.769-03

This st	<b>Loretta</b> is a psychological thriller that would make the player an accessory to the heroine’s crimes and would lead her through a self-crafted nightmare. This story is about a woman, dealing with betrayal, her husband’s infidelity, relationship problems and the difficult social situation of the 1940s.\n<br><br>\nConceptually and aesthetically, the game is inspired by the American art of the twentieth century, the works of Andrew Wyeth and Edward Hopper, film noir of the 40s-50s, thrillers by Alfred Hitchcock, the Philip Ridley movie "The Reflecting Skin", the books "1922" by Stephen King and "Lolita" by Vladimir Nabokov.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/loretta/lora600.png"><br><br><b>Story</b><br><br>\nThe year is 1947. Lora and Walter Harris move to a farm, which used to belong to his parents. Walter is a writer and Lora is a housewife. Both are quite unsuccessful.\n<br><br>\nThe family is going through financial difficulties. The situation is also complicated by the fact that Walter owes money to people from New York. And although the husband keeps it a secret from his wife, Lora has a suspicion. Moreover, she suspects him of cheating.\n<br><br>\nLora understands that she gave up her job, her dreams and other opportunities for her failure of a husband she doesn’t even love. Now she is stuck in a cold empty house barely making ends meet.\n<br><br>\nAs she struggles to make loan payments, she finds out that Walter’s publishing house has insured his life. In the event of his death, the insurance sum would be 30.000$. A plan is born in Lora’s mind.\n<br><br>\nLoretta is a story-driven adventure game in which gameplay focuses on choosing phrases in dialogue, interacting with objects, and making decisions: planning the murder and getting rid of the evidence. Killing a husband, trying to cover a crime, Loretta makes a player an accomplice. \n<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/loretta/mp4/ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br><br><b>Features:</b><br><br>\n- The plot can either turn into a web of dodgy lies, or into a crescendo of bloody murders.\n<br><br>\n- Player is free to decide the fate of the character.\n<br><br>\n- Freedom of choice​.\n<br><br>\n- Many endings.\n\n\n            \n    	526.19	1969-12-31	BR0	49	2023-01-04 00:52:01.596-03	\N	\N	2023-01-04 00:52:07.885-03	2023-01-04 00:52:08.052-03

Both empires, however, were severely weakened. Six years later, in 634, the newly Islamized Arabs erupted forth from Arabia, quickly defeating the Byzantines and Persians. By 750, under the Umayyad Caliphate, the Muslim Arab Empire stretched from Spain to the borders of India.<br><br>\nThe Byzantine Empire, after losing its Levantine and North African provinces, survived the initial Islamic advance. Constantinople endured a year long siege (717-718), and this proved to be the beginning of the end for the Umayyad Caliphate. Eventually, weakened by defeats on the frontiers of their vast empire and internal unrest, the Umayyads were overthrown by the Abbasid dynasty. The great Islamic Empire was now split into many separate, and often competing states. The Byzantines grew stronger under the Macedonian Dynasty (867-1056), and ended the period more powerful than they had been for many centuries.<br><br>\nIn Northern Europe, Viking raids started in the late 8th century. Superb sailors, they used their longboats to strike across the Baltic and North Seas against towns, farms and monasteries, and raid as far as Seville and Constantinople. Eventually they settled down, and created important states in Normandy and the Kievan Rus. Their invasions of the British Isles resulted in centuries of intermittent warfare with the English, Irish and Scottish kingdoms.<br><br>\nCharlemagne ruled as King of the Franks from 768-814 AD. The kingdom he inherited already included most of modern France and parts of Germany. By his death in 814, his empire encompassed modern France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, northern Italy and a strip of northern Spain. In 800 he was crowned “Emperor of the Romans” by Pope Leo III. After his death the Carolingian Empire split into two main states, West Francia (modern France) and East Francia (modern Germany).<br><br>\nIn the 9th century the nomadic Magyars erupted into European history. Their western raids reached as far as Spain. Their defeat by the Germans at Lechfeld in 955 ended their threat to Western Europe and in 1000 their High Prince accepted Christianity and was recognised as King of Hungary by Pope Sylvester II, ruling under his Christian name of István (Stephen) I.\n<h4><br>\nSummary of features:</h4><ul><li>19 new factions</li><li>55 new units</li><li>76 new army lists</li><li>6 new Epic Battles</li><li>74 new Quick Battles</li><li>Expanded Custom Battles module.</li><li>Expanded Sandbox Campaign module.</li><li>6 new historically-based campaigns.</li><li>New Allies feature added in accompanying game update.</li></ul><h4>Details:</h4><ul><li>19 new named factions: Andalusians, Bulgars, Croatians, Dailami, Fatimids, French, Ghaznavids, Khazars, Khorasanians, Magyars, Moravians, Navarrese, Normans, Pechenegs, Polish, Rus, Scots, Serbians, Vikings.</li><li>55 new units: Huscarls (Spear), Huscarls (Axe), Mounted Huscarls, Berserkers, Well-Equipped Shieldwall (Offensive), Shieldwall (Offensive), Hirdsmen, Dismounted Hirdsmen, Picked Irish Foot (Axe), Irish Foot (Axe), Irish Kerns, (Dark Age) Armoured Lancers, Dismounted Armoured Lancers, (Dark Age) Lancers, Dismounted Lancers, (Dark Age) Armoured Cavalry (Light Spear), Dismounted Armoured Cavalry, (Dark Age) Cavalry (Light Spear), Dismounted Cavalry, Crossbowmen, Light Crossbowmen, Byzantine Kataphraktoi, Tagmatic Lancers &amp;

Free roam across the vibrant prison island of Peh, and choose whether to help or exploit its many citizens.<br><br>\n\nIf there’s one place that Master Thief Teriel avoids at all costs, it’s the prison island of Peh. But when a daring heist takes an unexpected turn, Teriel finds himself shackled on an airship bound for the infamous island. To make matters worse, the daemon inside his head makes it very clear that the thief will never leave unless he does exactly what he’s told.<br><br><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/seven_the_days_long_gone"><b>Seven: The Days Long Gone</b></a> you play as Teriel. You must use all of your cunning and clandestine skills to escape a web of deceit and betrayal, and ultimately survive Peh.\n\n<br><br><b></b><h4><b>EXPLORE A VIBRANT OPEN WORLD FROM AN ISOMETRIC PERSPECTIVE</b></h4> From the moment you set foot on Peh, the island is open to you. Sneak, run, climb, and fight your way across a colourful array of environments. You are free to explore wherever you please; only security checkpoints, monster-infested areas, and dangerous factions stand in your way!\n<b></b><h4><b>CHOOSE YOUR PLAYSTYLE</b></h4>  As a master thief, Teriel is well versed in the art of stealth. Get the jump on enemies from behind and above, fool everyone with cunning disguises, or just use the environment to keep out of sight entirely. If things go wrong, however, or you’re feeling impatient, there’s nothing to stop you from letting loose with an array of devastating weapons, and unleashing deadly magical skills upon your foes.\n<b></b><h4><b>ENCOUNTER A MYRIAD OF COLOURFUL CHARACTERS</b></h4>  Encounter an array of people, from despondent slaves and prisoners through to rich socialites. Just be sure to keep an eye out for the two major factions on Peh: the Biomancers and the Technomagi. In such a desperate place, there are many who will take any help they can get. Choose whether to help or exploit Peh’s inhabitants, but be prepared for the consequences.\n<b></b><h4><b>UNCOVER AN EPIC STORY OF DECEIT AND TREACHERY</b></h4> On Peh, everyone has an agenda, and often there’s more than meets the eye. Dive into a world teeming with distrust, and crushed between the machinations of mighty powers. Work with the daemon that has possessed you to complete a mission of utmost importance. The fate of the Vetrall Empire rests in your hands.\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            © 2016-2017 IMGN.PRO / FOOL'S THEORY all rights reserved.

Mostly because it actually has been. The side project that was supposed to take a few months instead sprawled into a retail game that has taken several years to complete.\n<br><br>\nBrave Earth wears its influences a bit... shamelessly on its sleeve. The game was originally conceived to be a freeware "study" game for me -- learning through emulation. But the product I'm releasing is more than just emulation. I've tried my best to both understand and then build upon one of my favorite eras in platformers to almost arrive at a uniquely different alternative reality. A more modern sensibility without playing like a modern take on a retro game.\n<br><br>\nAs George Lucas's Star Wars built upon and paid tribute Flash Gordon while establishing its own voice, I'm hoping Brave Earth can do the same.\n<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/brave_earth_prologue/pub.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br>\nThis is Dan Stern from Dangen Entertainment. I’m both pleased and proud to present Brave Earth: Prologue. \n<br><br>\nI’ve said in other places how happy I am for pixel art to have made a come back with the independent development scene. The pixel art in BEP is excellent, but what I have found to stand out and amaze me in this game is the meticulous care that Kayin put into designing the encounters. It doesn’t come as any surprise to me considering his previous work, but in no time at all I got the feeling that he was in my own head in a sense. \n<br><br>\nKayin’s complete understanding of player psychology is as enviable as it is rare in game development. I Wanna Be the Guy was a game that was completely designed around it. Traps spring up and invisible blocks bar your path, leading to your frequent death. It was almost as much a commentary on game design in a meta sense as it was a clever arrangement of platforming puzzles. \n<br><br>\nIn Brave Earth: Prologue, by contrast, traps and obstacles are laid bare before you. This is not a game meant to trick you cleverly, but rather to masterfully utilize a comprehensive understanding of what makes for a satisfying challenge.\n<br><br>\nIt’s remarkable that the game also leads the player along a logical path through the game’s world, with three totally different playable characters, no less. While level-based rather than open world, BEP still gave me a powerful sense of progress, journey and adventure. To find that depth of setting in a game with so much attention paid to the gameplay balance is impressive to say the least.\n<br><br>\nI couldn’t be more proud to work with a talented developer like Kayin. This game is a masterpiece of 8-bit era game design and it vastly raises the bar in my eyes as a gamer. I can’t wait for you all to experience it.\n\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT is a trademark of Dangen Entertainment.\nCopyright © 2017 Dangen Entertainment.

The team at DigiTales has applied numerous lessons from their first game Lacuna and proven solutions to detective game design problems to maximize player agency in the investigation process – all the while maintaining the tight pacing of a meaningful story that will ask you to reevaluate your moral compass and make increasingly tough decisions as the situation aboard the ship spirals out of control.<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/between_horizons/mp4/between-horizons_gameplay-gif-01_616p-compressed.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br><h4>Key Features of Between Horizons:</h4><ul><li><b>A New Kind Of Experience:</b> Between Horizons merges investigative-style gameplay with a branching sci-fi story in an ever-expanding Metroidvania-style environment.</li><li><b>Solving cases for yourself:</b> The flexible evidence system lets players assign clues to cases, confront ship denizens about them, and submit any case with evidence players have connected to it.

Such is the adrenaline-fueled thrill of The Looter.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/1.gif"><br><h4>STORY</h4>\nThe world is coming to an end. Everything is lost and destroyed, humanity is in disarray. Somewhere in this world there is Tortura, a giant forest that devoured the monuments of a past civilization. Tortura is a dangerous place. Not many people decide to live there, and those who dare are hiding behind thick walls and sleeping with their guns by their side. <br>\nThe story begins when the protagonist, a nameless looter, and his comrades reach the Watch Tower. It’s an old construction placed at the edge of Tortura, the last safe place with a vague sense of civilization. The pack is to be hired by the emissary of a local magnate hoping to find a cure for his terminal disease. The cure is supposedly in the Monastery,  a place where even the bravest looters don’t dare to venture. \n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/2.gif"><br><br>\nWhile making his way through Tortura, the protagonist is attacked and critically wounded by a strange creature. With no signs of life, his pack leaves him, presuming him dead. After some time, the protagonist wakes up fully healed, alone in seclusion. Abandoned and with no other choice, he decides to continue his way to the monastery, hoping to find his friends. While exploring the forest, meeting potentially dangerous strangers, looting everything in sight, and fighting ruthless creatures, the protagonist gets involved in events that will uncover the tragic story of Tortura with great evil lurking in the shadows.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/3.gif"><br><h4>RANGE &gt; MELEE</h4>\nThe Looter is all about bringing a gun to a mutant fight. Focused on using firearms such as the handgun, shotgun and assault rifle you will learn to dispatch all enemies with ease aiming at 360 angle before they get too close. And if they do? Trusty fireaxe and a variety of equipment such as frag grenades, flashbangs and landmines should do the trick.\n<br><h4>SECRET GARDENS</h4>\nTortura is full of secrets and hidden places and investigating them is rewarded. You will often have to be cunning, perceptive and curious to uncover every secret that this world keeps from you.\n<br><h4>MOOD BOARDS</h4>\nTortura is an empty, sombre place and you will have a chance to explore this strange yet familiar setting. Get ready to visit dilapidated buildings, deserted bunkers, empty bases while all the time on the lookout for more loot and deadly creatures that are always dangerously close. \n<br><h4>GET CRAFTY</h4>\nWhile gathering loot, players can also acquire materials that are used for crafting usable items. As the game progresses, the player will gain new blueprints and recipes for crafting certain items.\n<br><h4>THE LOOT</h4>\nOn your journey you will encounter all sorts of artefacts from the days gone - both carrying sentimental and more practical value. Find and bag items that you can collect, exchange and craft into new useful tools. \n<br><br><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nx6CmMNgrj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://items.gog.com/Retrovibe_discord_banner.png" style="width:100%"></a>	526.19	1969-12-31	BR0	71	2023-01-04 00:52:02.317-03	\N	\N	2023-01-04 00:52:08.18-03	2023-01-04 00:52:08.426-03

Starting with just a single Krellan battlecruiser, as you rise in the game's seven ranks (each rank has five missions), you'll gain more complexity, such as escorts, planetary invasions, and eventually full sector command. \n<br><br>\nEach mission is a randomly-generated galactic war sandbox, and while you have specific objectives, how you accomplish them is entirely up to you. No other space game gives you this much depth, detail and control. Fight, board, and capture ships, send landing parties and full invasion forces down to planets. Bombard cities (sparingly, as you want as many cities intact as possible) from orbit while avoiding planetary defense fire from high technology planets. It's all here.<p></p><br><h1>A Bit of Background/Quick Things to Keep in Mind</h1><p>Version 1.0 of this game was published by Interstel Corporation and distributed by Electronic Arts. When this game was originally released in 1989, it was rushed to market in order to get it in stores in time for the Christmas season. The result was a very buggy release. Debugging and development continued until 1991 with the release of an enhanced and fairly bug-free Version 1.5B, which is the most common version found on websites that provide old games. Then, in 2018, with the developer’s original 486 PC back in action, the author, Trevor Sorensen, resumed development to produce what is now 2.0.\n<br><br>\nAs this game came out in 1989, it has absolutely no multithreading of any kind. Therefore, due to the real-time nature of the game (although you can pause at any time), sometimes responses to your commands might be delayed a moment. Have patience with the game, it's doing a lot at one time, from calculating AI for dozens of ships and even individual torpedoes, to managing your ship's systems and much more. \n<br><br>\nWhile the game might look daunting at first, there are eight fully-documented and detailed tutorials in the game to help teach you everything from basic navigation to ship combat to planetary invasions and more. \n<br><br>\nAlso please note that there is no mouse control in this game, instead there is a detailed list of keyboard shortcuts at your disposal.  \n<br><br>\nThis is the pinnacle of the DOS gaming experience from the 1980s. Going in with these expectations will help you have a much better time. Thank you!</p><br><b><i>Star Fleet II: Krellan Commander</i></b> is the second in the Star Fleet series of advanced space strategy simulations. Having fought as an Alliance starship commander in Star Fleet I to stem the onslaught of the Krellan and Zaldron Empires, now you get a chance to try command on the "winning" side.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/star_fleet_ii_-_krellan_commander_version_2.0/sf2_015.png"><br><i>A Pitched Battle with an Enemy Starbase</i><br><br>\nAs Commander of a Krellan Battlecruiser with four destroyer escorts (forming a "battle fleet"), your mission is to explore the star systems of the United Galactic Alliance looking for planets to conquer and Alliance warships to destroy. Your ships are equipped with the latest technology, including phasers, homing torpedoes and deadly obliterator pods. Also at your command are elite shock troops for boarding and capturing enemy vessels, and legions of Krellan warriors for planetary invasions.\n<br><br><b><i>Star Fleet II</i></b> gives you more depth, complexity, and realism than any space war simulation before or since. But that's not all! <b><i>Star Fleet II</i></b> is actually two games in one. Every time you invade a planet, <b><i>Star Fleet II</i></b> switches to a complete planetary invasion game that allows you to control the conquering Krellan forces in their attempt to overwhelm the planetary defenders.\n<br><br>\nFrom up to dozens of military targets on the detailed planetary map, select and control up to eight invasion zones from your Invasion Control Screen, or take personal command of your units. Your objectives: to capture cities and factories; knock out shield generators, planetary defense phasers, point defense lasers, and missile launchers; and eliminate both UGA troops and native militia forces. Like combat in space, planetary combat is real-time (no turns, but you can pause!).\n<br><br>\nExplore uncharted star systems and planets - your landing parties may even discover the ruins of ancient civilizations that may contain beneficial alien artifacts. Attack and pillage planets, wipe out civilizations with a single command, interrogate prisoners from a captured starliner, then beam those prisoners into the sun or empty space to improve your crew's morale!

The game embraces social links and relationship building that affect both the course of the story and the scope of the player's skill.

The borders protected by the fierce King’s Knights are no longer secure. The fearsome orc clans, more numerous than ever, lurk on all roads. The proud nomadic peoples of the steppes are on the alert, for strange beasts prowl the darkness. Not even the stout dwarves, hidden in their underground palaces, seem safe from threat - from the unknown tunnels of its mines, a foul army of hideous creatures advances inexorably. \n<br><br>\nChaos seizes the World. Only the memory of the oldest recalls the exploits of a hero and a few warriors, who in other times fought against the forces of Chaos. Ianna, the mother of all living beings, gave the hero a powerful sword to enter the abyss and defeat evil. But that happened a long time ago. A new hero is needed, a chosen one who is worthy to wield the Sword and destroy the enemy... this time forever.<h4>FOUR PLAYABLE CHARACTERS</h4>Pick your Champion of Ianna — Tukaram, the Barbarian; Naglfar, the Dwarf; Sargon, the Knight; or Zoe, the Amazon — each with unique strengths, weaknesses, and fighting skills, as you hack ‘n slash your way through a blood-drenched quest to save the world from the forces of Chaos.<h4>BLOODY &amp; GORY COMBAT</h4> Learn devastating combo attacks and use them to slice your opponents into pieces. Hack off your foes’ limbs, then use them as weapons!<h4>A DETAILED &amp; DARK FANTASY WORLD</h4> Battle orcs, trolls, golems, demons, skeletons, and scores of malevolent enemy creatures as you explore treacherous tombs, frozen fortresses, demon spires, deserts, temples, and palaces.<h4>INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENTS</h4> Destroy in-game objects with fire or your fists as you solve puzzles and disarm traps that combine physics, hydraulic systems, and lethal traps!<h4>RE-RELEASE OF A TRUE GENRE-DEFINING GAME</h4> We are happy to bring Blade of Darkness back to life, an enduring classic that, at the time of its release, inspired many games in the action-adventure genre through its approach to combat. With this edition we've re-engineered the game to work on modern PC hardware, added widescreen support up to 4K resolution, introduced new display settings, and improved its overall stability. At the same time, the gameplay, content, and the story are untouched — featuring all the game’s quirks and charm.\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            © SNEG Ltd.

Without your support and feedback we wouldn’t be where we are today. Rise of the Giant is our way of saying thank you. Here’s a free DLC with a bunch of new content, mostly aimed at the people who have been hanging around since day 1, it’s high level and should offer more challenge than most sane people would think reasonable.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/dead_cells_-_rise_of_the_giant/CavernTravelling.gif"><h4>Features:</h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>New levels</b>: You’ve got a new level that’s connected to the main level structure and immediately available to anyone who’s finished the game at least once.

The 2D environments are colorful and enchanting, gameplay feels smooth and polished, not to mention the absolutely huge and very diversified world in which you can spend many hours just exploring. Treasure Adventure Game casts you in the role of a young boy who lands on an island that is a fragment of what was once a continent, destroyed in the war between a demon and a wizard. You accept quests, travel across the oceans, and generally have a bang-up time of being a little boy in a big world, out there looking for treasure and adventure. Your equipment consists of a hat, a parrot, and a boat that appears whenever you touch water. Combine those with the basic platforming abilities like jumping and crawling that you’re familiar with from every platforming game ever, and you’ve got the basics of a phenomenal romp across a huge world filled with treasure, maps, secrets, danger, and triumph.\n<br><br>\nThe music changes with the environments and day-night cycles, enhancing the feel the game is evoking and making you feel immersed in the world as you travel through it. The game has a retro feel, yes, but you really have to see it for yourself to understand what Treasure Adventure Game brings to the table. Since it’s free, of course, there is simply no reason not to!\n<br><br>\nTreasure Adventure Game was created by Stephen Orlando. He spent over 2 years of his life developing it. When you see the scope and detail in this game, it’s hard to believe that it was created by just one guy. But it was!

Earthly victories over seemingly impossible odds lead to the final conflict, where the ultimate challenge - the self - awaits.\n\n                    <ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point">Arguably the title responsible for the Ultima™ series' legend and the first RPG to break the “kill the bad guy and save the world” cliché</li><li class="description__features-point">A revolutionary title with a story so deep and complex that that it should be taught in schools</li><li class="description__features-point">Many hours of truly epic adventure in the vast and diverse world of Sosaria</li></ul><p class="description__copyrights">\n            © 1985, 2011 Electronic Arts Inc.\n        </p>	0.00	1985-09-15	BR0	19	2023-01-04 00:56:40.933-03	\N	\N	2023-01-04 00:56:47.578-03	2023-01-04 00:56:47.802-03

Stratagemini has been with us since the earliest days of development, supporting us every step of the way, providing extensive and enlightening feedback in the alpha, and helping to shape this community into what it is today. As a token of our eternal gratitude, we've recreated Tiger in the game so that he may roam with his human friend once more - if only in the Stolen Lands.\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            Pathfinder and Kingmaker are trademarks and copyrights owned exclusively by Paizo Inc. and used under license.
